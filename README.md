# FHIRBlaze
Welcome to FHIRBlaze!

## Overview
FHIRBlaze is a minimally viable Blazor WebAssembly application demonstrating how to interact with HL7 data from a Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) API.

## Architecture
A Blazor WebAssembly (wasm) application using the pattern of micro-frontends implemented by lazy-loading UI "modules" only when requested by navigation events from the client.

## Get Started
Here's what you'll need to run this application in your own environment.

### FHIR API (R4)
You will need access to a FHIR API that meets the HL7 R4 spec requirements. 
Host your own with one of these popular offerings:
* [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/fhir-portal-quickstart)
* [Azure FHIR Server (OSS)](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/QuickstartDeployPortal.md)
* [Firely Server](https://fire.ly/products/firely-server/)

OR, use one of these [publicly available test servers](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing).

### Web Host
There are many options for hosting a Blazor WebAssembly application. This repo contains a Github Action workflow to automatically deploy the site to Azure Static Web Apps. 
Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/deploy-blazor) to learn more.

Other options include:
* Azure App Service
* Azure Blob Storage static web
* [and more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* Localhost

### Next Steps
[Fork this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fhirblaze/fork) to modify or add your own functionality.

## Quickstart Running Locally
* Open Solution with Visual Studio
* Right click on the FhireBlaze poject and select "Manage User Secrets"
* Add your information from app registrations
```JSON
{
  "AzureAd": {
    	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/", 
    	"Domain": "<Your domain>.onmicrosoft.com", ?
    	"TenantId": "<add the tenant id from the azure tenant containing your app registrations here>",
    	"ClientId": "<add the client id from your client app registration here>"
    	
   },
  "ChestistApp": {
    // used with the integrated SMART on FHIR App. 
    "LaunchUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
  },
  "Api": {
    "Scope": "<copy from app registration info will look like: api://[guid]/user_impersonation>",
    "BaseUri": "http://localhost:7275"
  }
}
``` 
* Compile
* Run/debug local
